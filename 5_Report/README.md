# M3_WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM
* This Wiper Speed Control System is utilised in all sorts of automobiles, and its main function is to remove the rain air drops from the vehicle's front screen. Because driving a vehicle in the rain is very difficult, so, we will use wipers to clear the front screen of the vehicle, which is a mirror, so that even in the rain, we may drive the vehicle.

## WORKING PROCESS
* If the button is pressed ONCE, the car will be on AC mode.

* If the button is pressed TWICE, the car will be on Ignition mode.

* If the button is pressed THREE times, wiper turn on.

* If the button is pressed FOUR times, wiper turn off.

# SWOT Analysis

## Strength
* Visibility, while drive the car.
* The wiper does not stop in the middle of the window during drive.
* Safety - a main strength.

## Weakness
* High cost.
* Not automatic.

## Threats
* If the board is repaired, It cannot be replaced quickly.
